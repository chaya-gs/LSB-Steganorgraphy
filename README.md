# C-Projects--Steganography

## Brief Abou the project
      The objective was to send a secret text encrypted inside an image of bmp file format. Encrypt the length of the secret text and the message into the LSB of         the image bytes. Then decrypting length and secrete message. The final output is the secret message after decrypting.

## Technologies used
      Advanced C – Pointers, Bitwise operations, Functions, Command line arguments, File operations.

## Key challenges & Learnings 
    • Understanding of pixels and header of bmp image file by doing literature study. 
    • Transmitting the encrypted information to the destination without changing properties of original image.
